## Syntax highlighting for lex/flex input files
syntax "lex" "\.(l|lex|flex)$"
color red "%[^[[:space:]]]*"
## String highlighting.  You will in general want your comments and
## strings to come last, because syntax highlighting rules will be
## applied in the order they are read in.
color brightyellow "<[^=        ]*>" ""(\\.|[^"])*""
## This string is VERY resource intensive!
color brightyellow start=""(\\.|[^"])*\\[[:space:]]*$" end="^(\\.|[^"])*""
## Comments
color brightblue start="/\*" end="\*/"
